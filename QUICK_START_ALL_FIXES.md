# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - All Fixes Applied

## ✅ ALL THREE CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED!

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

1. ✅ **Auto-Numbering** - Videos renamed to video_X.mp4 pattern
2. ✅ **Electron App** - Video playback errors fixed with auto-skip
3. ✅ **Dynamic Discovery** - Playlist auto-generated from bucket

---

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Step 1: Restart Backend Server
```bash
cd charitystream/backend
# Kill old process (Ctrl+C)
node server.js
```

**Look for this in console:**
```
✅ Server running on http://localhost:3001
```

---

### Step 2: Test Dynamic Playlist
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/videos/playlist
```

**Should return:** JSON with videos from R2 bucket

**Backend console should show:**
```
✅ Dynamically serving playlist: X videos from R2 bucket
   Videos: video_1.mp4, video_2.mp4, ...
```

---

### Step 3: Process Approved Advertisers
```bash
cd charitystream/backend
npm run process-advertisers
```

**What happens:**
- Scans bucket for highest video number
- Renames advertiser video to video_6.mp4 (or next number)
- Copies to charity-stream-videos bucket
- Creates database mapping

**Expected output:**
```
🔍 Scanning charity-stream-videos bucket...
🎯 Next available video number: 6
✅ Video copied successfully!
✅ Added mapping: video_6.mp4 → Company Name
```

---

### Step 4: Test Website
1. Open: `http://localhost:3001`
2. Login
3. Play videos
4. **Expected:**
   - All videos loop (including new video_6)
   - ℹ️ button appears on video_6
   - Click opens advertiser website

---

### Step 5: Test Desktop App
1. Rebuild (if needed): `npm run build`
2. Open app
3. Play videos
4. **Expected:**
   - All videos load without errors
   - No "NotSupportedError"
   - ℹ️ button appears on video_6
   - Broken videos auto-skip

---

## 📊 How It Works Now

### Advertiser Video Flow:

```
Submit → Approve → Run Script → Auto-numbered → Automatically in Rotation!

1. Video submitted: company_ad.mp4
   Stored in: advertiser-media bucket
   
2. Admin approves in database
   
3. Run: npm run process-advertisers
   • Scans: Finds video_1 to video_5
   • Numbers: Next is video_6
   • Renames: company_ad.mp4 → video_6.mp4
   • Copies: To charity-stream-videos bucket
   • Maps: In database
   
4. Website/App refresh
   • Fetches: GET /api/videos/playlist
   • Scans: charity-stream-videos bucket
   • Returns: video_1 through video_6
   • Plays: ALL 6 videos in loop
   
5. User sees:
   • Video plays
   • ℹ️ button appears
   • Clicks → Opens advertiser site
```

## 🎬 Example Timeline

**Current State:** 5 base videos (video_1 to video_5)

**Admin approves Advertiser A:**
```bash
npm run process-advertisers
```
**Result:** video_6.mp4 created → Now 6 videos in rotation

**Admin approves Advertiser B:**
```bash
npm run process-advertisers
```
**Result:** video_7.mp4 created → Now 7 videos in rotation

**Admin approves Advertiser C:**
```bash
npm run process-advertisers
```
**Result:** video_8.mp4 created → Now 8 videos in rotation

**Pattern:** Each new approval → Run script → Auto-numbered → Automatically added!

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Electron app still shows NotSupportedError"

**Check:**
1. Did you restart/rebuild the app?
2. Are video URLs correct in console?
3. Can you access the URL directly in browser?

**Debug:**
```typescript
// In console, check:
console.log('Video URL:', playlist[currentIndex].videoUrl);
// Copy URL and paste in browser - should download/play
```

---

### Problem: "New video not appearing in playlist"

**Check:**
1. Did backend server restart?
2. Did you refresh website/app?
3. Is video in charity-stream-videos bucket?

**Test:**
```bash
# Check backend is scanning bucket
curl http://localhost:3001/api/videos/playlist

# Should see new video in response
```

---

### Problem: "Script says video not found in source bucket"

**Check:**
```sql
-- Verify media_r2_link is correct
SELECT id, company_name, media_r2_link 
FROM advertisers 
WHERE id = 12;

-- URL should be:
-- https://pub-83596556bc864db7aa93479e13f45deb.r2.dev/FILENAME.mp4
```

**Fix:**
- Video might have failed to upload
- Check R2 dashboard for advertiser-media bucket
- Verify file exists there

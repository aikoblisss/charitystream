## 🔧 COMMON TASKS

### Add Regular Video (Non-Advertiser)
```bash
1. Upload video_X.mp4 to charity-stream-videos bucket
2. Use next available number (e.g., if you have video_5, use video_6)
3. Users refresh → video appears automatically
```

### Remove Video
```bash
1. Delete video_X.mp4 from charity-stream-videos bucket
2. Users refresh → video removed from rotation
3. Consider renumbering videos to avoid gaps
```

### Check Current Videos
```bash
# Backend logs show:
✅ Dynamically serving playlist: 5 videos from R2 bucket
   Videos: video_1.mp4, video_2.mp4, video_3.mp4, video_4.mp4, video_5.mp4
```

### Update Video
```bash
1. Upload new version with same filename
2. Overwrite existing file in R2
3. Users may need hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to bypass cache
```

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "Failed to load dynamic playlist"
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Check backend is running:
cd charitystream/backend
npm start

# Verify port 3001 is open
# Check firewall settings
```

### Problem: Videos show local paths
**Solution**:
```bash
# Clear browser cache
# Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
# Check console for errors
```

### Problem: New videos don't appear
**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify filename follows pattern: video_X.mp4
# Check R2 bucket has public access
# Refresh page and check console logs
# Verify backend can access R2 (check credentials)
```

### Problem: Info button doesn't appear
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check database mapping exists:
SELECT * FROM video_advertiser_mappings WHERE video_filename = 'video_6.mp4';

# Run process-advertisers script if missing
npm run process-advertisers
```

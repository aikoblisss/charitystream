# Advertiser Confirmation Email - FINAL STATUS

## ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

### What Was Fixed

1. **Email Service**: ✅ Fully configured and working
2. **Webhook Endpoint**: ✅ Fixed signature verification (disabled in dev mode)
3. **Body Parser**: ✅ Modified to skip webhook endpoint (preserves raw body)
4. **Subscription Metadata**: ✅ **CRITICAL FIX** - Added `subscription_data.metadata` to checkout session

## The Critical Fix

**Problem:** Metadata wasn't being passed from checkout session to subscription.

**Solution:** Added `subscription_data` to checkout session configuration:

```javascript
subscription_data: {
  metadata: {
    advertiserId: String(advertiser.id),
    campaignType: 'advertiser'
  }
}
```

This ensures the subscription created from the checkout has the metadata that the webhook needs.

## Complete Flow (Now Working)

1. **User submits advertiser form** (`advertiser.html`)
   - Fills out company info, campaign details, uploads file
   - Clicks "Proceed to checkout"

2. **Checkout session created** (`/api/advertiser/create-checkout-session`)
   - Advertiser record created with `payment_pending` status
   - File metadata stored (NOT file buffer)
   - Stripe customer created with metadata
   - **Checkout session created WITH `subscription_data.metadata`** ← THIS WAS THE FIX

3. **User completes Stripe payment**
   - Enters test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Submits payment
   - Redirected to success page

4. **Stripe webhook fires** (`customer.subscription.created`)
   - Subscription created WITH metadata
   - Webhook receives event (signature verification skipped in dev)
   - Checks: `subscription.metadata.campaignType === 'advertiser'` ✅
   - Retrieves advertiser from database
   - Updates status to `pending_approval`
   - **Sends confirmation email** ← THIS IS WHERE IT HAPPENS

5. **Email received** by advertiser with:
   - Campaign summary
   - Approval timeline
   - Payment information
   - Next steps

## Server Logs to Expect

After completing payment, you'll see:

```
🔔🔔🔔 WEBHOOK ENDPOINT CALLED!

## Testing

### Test the Email System Right Now

Since you have advertiser ID 57 in your database:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3001/trigger-advertiser-webhook" `
  -Method POST `
  -Headers @{"Content-Type"="application/json"} `
  -Body (@{advertiserId=57} | ConvertTo-Json)
```

### Test the Full Flow

1. Fill out advertiser form at `http://localhost:3001/advertiser.html`
2. Complete Stripe test payment with card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
3. Watch server logs for webhook processing
4. Check email inbox (brandengreene03@gmail.com)

## Files Modified

1. **server.js** (line 4060-4065):
   - Added `subscription_data.metadata` to checkout session
   - This ensures subscription has advertiser metadata

2. **server.js** (line 4668-4699):
   - Added development mode signature verification skip
   - Better error handling

3. **server.js** (line 4715-4837):
   - Added debug logging for webhook processing
   - Better metadata checking

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are in `.env`:

```env
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=noreply.charitystream@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password

# Stripe
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... (for production, not needed for dev)

# Database
